    "Mumbai is the commercial capital of India and has evolved into a global financial hub. For several decades it has been the home of India's main financial services, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment. From being an ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, Mumbai has become South Asia's largest city and home of the world's most prolific film industry. This influx in economy has created a lot of jobs in the city which has resulted in mass immigration from other cities in India and even from outside of India. Since the market is so volatile, employees prefer to rent apartments rather than buying a property.\n",
